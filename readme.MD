# Arduino with USB serial shield to recieve midi input over USB.
this is an attempt to see if a midi device (this is developed with a AKAI MPD218) can be used as a controller for ardiuno projects.
the MPD has 6 controls and 16 pads, which could be used for somthing internesting.
this project trys to decode the midi messages and fire off associated callbacks.
